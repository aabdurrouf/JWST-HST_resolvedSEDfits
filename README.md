# piXedfit spatially resolved SED analysis with JWST and HST imaging data 

This repository provides tutorial and examples of the spatially resolved SED analysis with JWST and HST imaging data, similar to the analyses performed in [Abdurro'uf et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230102209A/abstract). 

While this repository is still under construction, anyone interested can contact Abdurrouf (fabdurr1@jhu.edu) for any inquiry related to this work.
