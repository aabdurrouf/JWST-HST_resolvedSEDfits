# Spatially resolved SED analysis on JWST and HST imaging data using piXedfit 

This repository provides a simple tutorial of the spatially resolved SED analysis with JWST and HST imaging data, similar to the analyses performed in [Abdurro'uf et al. (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230102209A/abstract).
