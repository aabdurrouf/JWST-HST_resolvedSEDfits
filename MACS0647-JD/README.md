# Photometry of MACS0647-JD

This repository contains analysis codes for measuring the photometry of the MACS0647-JD (a triply-lensed galaxy at z~11; [Coe et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...762...32C/abstract); [Hsiao et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221014123H/abstract)), especially its two clump components (A and B).  

There are two types of photometry measurements performed here: (1) the photometry of individual clumps measured with elliptical apertures, and (2) the photometry measured with rectangular apertures resembling the NIRSpec slits.
