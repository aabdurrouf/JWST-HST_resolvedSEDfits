# Photometry of MACS0647-JD

This repository contains analysis codes for measuring the photometry of the MACS0647-JD (a triply-lensed galaxy at z~11), especially its two clump components (A and B).  

There are two types of photometry measurements performed here: (1) the photometry of individual clumps measured with elliptical apertures, and (2) the photometry measured with rectangular slits
