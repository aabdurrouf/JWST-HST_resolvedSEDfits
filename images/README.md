Download JWST/NIRcam and HST imaging data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10-SnmRvmBtCoo6C_bHPwDSEGKu7xiizC?usp=sharing) and put them in this directory.

These images were processed using [Grizli](https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli). Grizli processed images v6 along with the source catalogs are available at [link](https://github.com/gbrammer/grizli/blob/master/docs/grizli/image-release-v6.rst).
The images are registered to the same WCS information based on GAIA DR3 and drizzeled to a common pixel size using [ASTRODRIZZLE](https://drizzlepac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/astrodrizzle.html).
All HST images and JWST NIRCam LW (Long wavelength) images are drizzled to 0.04''/pixel, while JWST NIRCam SW (Short wavelength) images are drizzled to 0.02''/pixel.
