# Tutorial for constructing the empirical PSFs and convolution kernels for PSF matching of HST and JWST images

The empirical PSFs and convolution kernels produced from this process are available for download at [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OPdtUTWsLiJ3J3beoaBFq97G0a8LBOSv?usp=sharing). A full version of the jupyter notebook file for generating the empirical PSFs can also be found there.

This analysis mainly uses [Photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
